- 👋 Hi, I’m @Hobo-Hilly
My real name is Carl Shaw and I am an Ethical Hacker looking for my first home.
- 👀 I’m interested in Cyber Security! I have spent over 200 hours on  https://www.itpro.tv/ 
-  And I currently sit in the top 2% of users for the security training platform TryHackMe https://tryhackme.com/dashboard. I am trying to get my foot in the door anywhere that will
-  take me and teach me more security. I wanted to be a cop when I grew up but life got in the way as it tends to do
-  I love computers and cell phones so I saw cyber security as a second chance at a childhood dream. I am self-taught and proud of it.
-  I learned a lot from Itpro.tv, John Hammond Try Hack Me Write-ups on Youtube, 
-  And Ippsec walkthroughs on Hack the Box via YouTube
-  
-  I have completed the PenTest Plus curriculum on Try Hack Me and Itpro.tv.  I started this for educational and professional purposes so I can help prove my education to potential employers. 
-I have taken what I think are pretty good notes over the last few years and this seems like the perfect place to store them.
-  And hopefully, prove to potential employers that I know my stuff.
- 🌱 I’m currently working through the CEH Certified Ethical Hacking Course through Itpro.tv. I am also currently going back and creating write up's for 
- some of my favorite rooms in TryHackMe.
- I am going to post small snippets of notes and tools that I use regularly. 
- I hope that someone somewhere gets use out of this repository. Even if its just one person, its worth it. 
- Because at the end of the day, it is all about trying to be of service! 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything security-related but mostly small mundane bash/python/PowerShell scripts for now...
- 📫 How to reach me I can be reached at  Vincentcid96@gmail.com


 To any potential employer reading this. Please feel free to reach out and give me feedback on what you might like to see from your point of view.
 I am always open to helpful suggestions. Especially if it can help me get a job in security! Thanks for your time and in the words of one of my favorite podcasts.
  "Keep on coding!"
